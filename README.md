# ngBoilerplate + Sass + Compass vagrant environment

This is a simple vagrant VM that enables you to quickly start
working with [ngBoilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) and Compass/Sass

## Requirements

- Virtual Box
- Vagrant

## Get it done

```bash
git clone repo dir_name
cd dir_name
vagrant up
``` 

Wait for it to download the OS and install everything you need.

For windows users, you should use [Samba](https://github.com/franleplant/debian-based-samba-dance) instead of Vagrant / Virtual box's native share directories. For the rest of OS, use share directories.
